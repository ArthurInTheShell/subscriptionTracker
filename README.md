# Subscription Tracker Command Line Version

This tool is developed by Junhao Arthur Chen under WTFPL
![image of the wtfpl license](wtfpl-badge-1.png "wtfpl badge"). I build this tool out of the concern that there are some good subscription tracker tools out there but they cost money $$$. This one cost some slightly damage to my wist while I am coding. As a (almost) broke college student, I chose the latter. I hope this tool could help us manage our subscription well and **stop us from wasting money to zombie subscription**.

To use this tool, you need to have python 3 installed. Run this tool by entering the following in the command line:
```
python3 subscription.py
```
The [subscription.md](subscription.md) file is the output, while the [subscription.csv](subscription.csv) is a file where data is sotred in a neat format.
